# Azure-DevOps-Service-Connection

create a service connection that enables Azure Pipelines to access your Azure subscription. Azure Pipelines uses this service connection to deploy the code to Azure resources.

**Important** : Make sure that you're signed in to both the Azure portal and Azure DevOps under the same Microsoft account.
